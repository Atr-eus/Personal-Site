## Current State

I wasn't in a hurry to make a portfolio. However, I've been learning Japanese for the last couple of months, and I think I've reached the point of being able to do some writing in the language. Therefore, the primary objective of this site for now is serving as a blog-*like* platform where I write about random stuff. You are welcome to contact me regarding any mistakes I might have made in my writings.

## Roadmap for the Future

I'll wait until I find my niche on the field and have some real work done on it to showcase before I complete the site. Nonetheless, I might work on design-related aspects of the site from time to time.

- [ ] A creative homepage. The design should be related to my niche.
- [ ] The contact me page. I might get this done soon.
- [x] The blog page. It needs some work, but it's mostly done.
- [ ] A work showcase page.
- [ ] An about page.
- [ ] Add some minimal animation. This is a long-term goal.
